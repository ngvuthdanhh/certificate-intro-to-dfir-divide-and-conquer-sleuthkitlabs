# 01 — Evidence Handling

## Chain of Custody Workflow
- Record acquisition time, location, and handler.
- Maintain an unbroken handoff log.
- Use tamper-evident storage methods.
- Document all actions taken on evidence.

## Integrity Validation
- Hash evidence before and after imaging.
- Compare checksums to validate integrity.
- Store hashes in the case record and report.

## Imaging Workflow
- Determine logical vs physical collection.
- Avoid interacting directly with original media.
- Use write-blocking in all acquisition steps.
- Store clean copies and work only on duplicates.

## Storage Strategy (3-2-1 Model)
- 3 total copies  
- 2 different storage mediums  
- 1 off-site copy  

## Evidence Isolation Checklist
- Disconnect compromised systems from networks.
- Prevent system modifications.
- Restrict access to minimal authorized personnel.
