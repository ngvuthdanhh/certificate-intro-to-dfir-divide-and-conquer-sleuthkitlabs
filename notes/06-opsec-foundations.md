# 06 – OPSEC Foundations (Adversary-Focused Forensics)

## OPSEC Principles
Attackers hide:
- Infrastructure identity  
- Operator routines  
- Tooling fingerprints  

## DFIR Perspective
We analyze:
- Mistakes in OPSEC  
- Metadata leakage  
- Misconfigurations  
- Reused indicators  

These help attribution and threat intelligence.
